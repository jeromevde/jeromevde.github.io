## Modafnil


[Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2654794/) summarize part of the current research around the modes of action of Modafnil.

Modafnil is a wake-promoting agent primarily used for treating sleep disorders like narcolepsy, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. It's also being researched for potential use in various conditions including stimulant addiction. 

**Monoaminergic** (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine) Effects. Modafinil influences multiple neurotransmitter systems including histamine (HA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA). However, it doesn't bind strongly to any single receptor or site, suggesting a complex, indirect mechanism. Modafinil has some interaction with the **dopamine** transporter (DAT), but its effects are not solely through this pathway. It enhances **serotonin** transmission indirectly, particularly in response to other stimulatory methods. Modafinil increases **NE** levels, particularly in areas like the locus coeruleus, influencing wakefulness but not necessarily other autonomic functions.

**Glutamate and GABA**. Effects vary by brain region; modafinil increases glutamate in some areas (like the hypothalamus and hippocampus) but not in others (like the substantia nigra at non-high doses). Consistently reduces GABA in various brain regions, often through a serotonergic pathway (increased serotonin activity, can indirectly decrease GABA activity to promote wakefulness), suggesting an overall increase in neural excitability.
