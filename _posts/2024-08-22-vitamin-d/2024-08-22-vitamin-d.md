# Intro

[Vitamin D: Production, Metabolism and Mechanisms of Action]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278935/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278935/)) is both a hormone (self-produced in skin) and a vitamin (found in food and necessary in small quantitiy for metabolic function). It acts as a hormone modulator on different cells with the right receptors

# Pathways, forms and levels

Vitamin D is measured in _ng/ml_ or in _mmol/l_. The conversion factor between the two is 2.5.

| ng/ml | mmol/l |
| ----- | ------ |
| 10 | 25 |
| 20 | 50 |
| 30 | 75 |
| 40 | 100 |
| 50 | 125 |

## Circadian rhythm


## Variation by race

[Vitamin D status is a biological determinant of health disparities, 2013, Weishaar et al.]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415504/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415504/)) produces the following graph, and in line with [Optimal vitamin D3 daily intake of 2000IU inferred from modeled solar exposure of ancestral humans in Northern Tanzania, Krzyścin et al. 2016]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27043260/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27043260/)), which measured vitamin D levels in Hadza hunter gatherers, suggests aiming for an optimal level of **110 mmol/l** or **45 ng/ml**

## Variation by geography

[A systematic review of vitamin D status in populations worldwide, 2014, Hilger et al.]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23930771/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23930771/)) produce the following graph:

## Variation by season

[Temporal status between vitamin D and PTH 2015]([https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118108.g001](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118108.g001)) describes the seasonal variation of vitamin D, derived form 3.8 million laboratory results in American adults.

## Effectiveness of supplementation

[The Importance of Body Weight for the Dose Response Relationship of Oral Vitamin D Supplementation and Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Healthy Volunteers, Ekwaru et al., 2014](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267871645_The_Importance_of_Body_Weight_for_the_Dose_Response_Relationship_of_Oral_Vitamin_D_Supplementation_and_Serum_25-Hydroxyvitamin_D_in_Healthy_Volunteers) from the unviersity of Alberta publish a dose dependent serum vitamin D response curve, but the cruve shows high variability and is incosistent with other studies for higher supplementation levels, leading to believe people with higher supplementations don't maintain if as long, possibly inducing a bias. They find however that body weight is a significant factor, and that obese people might need up to 3 times the dosis.

[Daily oral dosing of vitamin D3 using 5000 TO 50,000 international units a day in long-term hospitalized patients: Insights from a seven year experience]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/)) publish the percentiles specifically for 5000 IU and 10000 IU that plateau after a few months:

But be careful that they fall back pretty quickly when supplementations stops. [Effect of a Single Oral Dose of 600,000 IU of Cholecalciferol on Serum Calciotropic Hormones in Young Subjects with Vitamin D Deficiency: A Prospective Intervention Study]([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45365637_Effect_of_a_Single_Oral_Dose_of_600000_IU_of_Cholecalciferol_on_Serum_Calciotropic_Hormones_in_Young_Subjects_with_Vitamin_D_Deficiency_A_Prospective_Intervention_Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45365637_Effect_of_a_Single_Oral_Dose_of_600000_IU_of_Cholecalciferol_on_Serum_Calciotropic_Hormones_in_Young_Subjects_with_Vitamin_D_Deficiency_A_Prospective_Intervention_Study)) publish the following graph of vitamin D 25-OH levels after a single dose of 600000 IU of vitamin D3:

# Dental health

##### Prenatal and early development vitamin D ??

[Association between Vitamin D Levels and Dental Caries: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Cross-Sectional Studies, 2023, Mahmood et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/17/9883) link vitamin D defficiency to an increased risk of dental caries. It is not immediately clear through what mechanism this happens, either through regulation of immune system, or possibly through increased calcium absorption and resulting higher salivary concentration.

# Mental Health

[Vitamin D: A potent regulator of dopaminergic neuron differentiation and function

[Vitamin D, light and mental health, 2010, Humble](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1011134410001879) argue vitamin D receptors [VDR]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin\_D\_receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D_receptor)) are present in the central nervous system, and that calcitriol (the active vitamin D hormone) affects numerous neurotransmitters and neurotrophic (making/maintaining neurons) factors. Schizophrenia and autism have been hypothetically linked to developmental (prenatal) vitamin D deficiency and low levels have been noted in adults. Mental problems are listed among the symptoms of rickets. The evolution towards more indoor activity has come (coincidence ?) with increased depression and documented autism. Calcitriol activates the gene expression of the enzyme [tyrosine hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine\_hydroxylase), which is considered the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the [catecholamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine) (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine).

Vitamin D plays a role against brain oxidation by increase the expression of [γ-glutamyl transpeptidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-glutamyltransferase) which is used to form glutathion, and in animal models vitamin d protects against [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)] (excitory neurotransmitter) induced neurotoxicity.

Vitamin D is related to uv-b exposure, and thus it's effects on mood could be associated to seasonal mood disorders.

# Immune health

[Vitamin D and immune function: an overview](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/vitamin-d-and-immune-function-an-overview/302152110AEE222430F44164E53FEA90) presents the discoveries of the link between immunity and vitamin D over the last decades.

# Bone health

INCONSISTENT CORRELATION !!??

Vitamin D has both a direct (through receptor binding) and indirect (through increased calcium absorption) on bone health. [Vitamin D and Bone]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3688475/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3688475/)) reviews the relative importance of the direct and indirect effect of vitamin D. In vitamin D resistant growing rats, a rescue diet fortified in Calcium seems to offset the negative effects of the unavailable vitamin D, highlighting the possible dominance of the indirect effect.

Surprisingly, studies on vitamin D and bone density are mixed. [Effects of vitamin D supplements on bone mineral density: a systematic review and meta-analysis, 2013, Reid et al.]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24119980/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24119980/)) from the university of Auckland finds small consistent benefit at the femoral neck. Explanations might be that vitamin D levels were not critical or that supplementation was insufficient. But going a bit deeper in the study, one can find that in most of the studies the participants were only slightly defficient, and given a small dose of vitamin D (sometimes along calcium) for a period of 6 months to 5 years. The estimated effect on femoral bone density if 1% in bone mass density increase. One can also deduce from this that vitamin D and calcium for building the skelet is a slow incremental process. And even not decreasing (considering the age of the participants in the studies) is already a good thing. I would be curious to see what the effects are on children... Bone density increases rapidly during childhood, then stabilizes and start rapidly declining after 50.

Well, [Effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in healthy children: systematic review and meta-analysis]([https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7254.short](https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7254.short)) from university of Tasmania, Australia find similar results for children with estimated effects on total and lumbar smine bone density of 2.6% and 1.7%. So it would seem that it's just a slow process, effects might compound over years, combined with physical exercice and other factors.

[Effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone density in men and women 65 years of age or older, 1997, Hughes et al.]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9278463/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9278463/)) from from Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging find modest effects, typically around 1%, in bone density increase for men and women over 65 years of age given 500mg calcium and 700 IU of vitamin D over a three year period.

[Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D Supplementation on Volumetric Bone Density and Bone Strength]([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2748796](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2748796)) performed a double blinded placebo controlled study in canada on 311 healthy 60 year olds at doses of 400, 4000 and 10000 IU and surprisingly find a deletarious effect of vitamin D at the higer concentrations. Vitamin D levels didn't increase in the 400IU group and increased from 80 nmol/l to 130 nmol/l in the 4000IU and 200 nmol/l for the 10000 IU group. 76% of participants received 300mg calcium daily. At baseline, participants had normal (81%) or low (19%) total hip areal BMD, which might be an explanation for these results.
